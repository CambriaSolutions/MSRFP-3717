Cambria team followed the intuitive approach of Agile process and Human-Centered Design to develop the prototype that led the need to add more data elements and relevant data. Based on the user research and additional user stories, Cambria saw the need for additional attributes *[[Additional Dataset]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Provider-Data/MS%20ITS%20RFP%203717-Vendor%20Challenge%20Dataset%20(FT).xlsx)*  *[[Additional Dataset Process]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Provider-Data/Extended%20Provider%20Data%20Service.pdf)* 

# U.S. Digital Services Playbook
We followed the Digital Services Playbook and created a *[document](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/US%20Digital%20Services%20Playbook%20Checklist.md)* describing how we used the plays.


In developing this prototype, we utilized several human-centered design techniques. These techniques created an understanding of user needs, behaviors, and goals that were incorporated into the functional components of our prototype. The functional description document contains the design decisions and assumptions made, with corresponding rationale. *[[Design Decisions]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Functional%20Description.pdf)*

# Documentation

# Brief Description of the Project

Cambria Solutions developed this prototype for the Mississippi Department of Human Services (MDHS) Agency using Human Centered Design principles, Agile development methodology, and Open source technologies. This tool will empower parents and caseworkers to find quality child care before and after school, during the day, or whenever it may be needed. Our goal is to provide comprehensive information needed for decision-making in an informative, easy, and helpful way. Our database is designed for parents who qualify for the Child Care Certificate Program, a federally funded program designed to provide parents with assistance for child care tuition. 

Through feedback from actual caseworkers and foster parents, our multidisciplinary team completed the prototype over the course of six sprints. Our responsive web design is user-friendly and accessible across multiple platforms. An incremental and iterative developmental methodology allowed us to incorporate user feedback and changing requirements, allowing us to release on a scheduled deployment.

Cambria Solutions utilized both traditional practices and Human Centered Design methodologies in conducting its research. This research formed the basis for understanding features and the usability of the solution in creating a helpful and informative search for child care providers. *[[Research Findings]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User-Research/User_Research_and_Findings.pdf)*

In developing this prototype, we utilized several human-centered design techniques: (1) user stories, (2) personas, (3) user interviews, (4) rapid prototyping using wireframes, (5) screen design sketches, and (6) usability testing. We started developing our first user story within a couple of days. *[[Initial User Stories]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts/User%20Stories%20(Spreadsheet).xlsx)* *[[User Stories]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User%20Stories.pdf)*

We built our solution using open-source frameworks and libraries that  helped facilitate collaboration between members of a cross-disciplinary team, as well as rapid prototyping and iteration. Our solution is based on .NET Core which is a fast and modular open source platform for creating server applications that run on Windows, Linux and Mac.  It leverages traditional Model/View/Controller patterns (MVC) that are already familiar to a significant pool of technologists.  In addition We used several other open source technologies such as Yoeman, Bower, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai and Kudu. *[[Our Technology Stack]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Technology%20Stack.md)*

We created a user experience that was intuitive to the needs of actual foster parents and case workers. Our cross-functional team met face-to-face in conference rooms, interviewed system users, had break out meetings, and collaborated daily to develop a prototype that exemplifies not only our technical and agile skills but the human-centered design principles. This document contains the functional description for all the components of the prototype. *[[Functional Description]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Functional%20Description.pdf)*

Git allowed us to share and collaborate on code and assets, while GitHub hosts our git repository and has collaboration, bug and enhancement tracking and sprint/issue management features. *[[Bugs and Issues]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Bugs%20and%20Issues%20Management.pdf)*

# Team Structure

Cambria assembled a mutidisciplinary and collaborative team that represented diverse backgrounds including few resources working remotely. Those involved included developers, visual designers, business analysts, technical architects, managers, writers, users and Product Managers. The roles were assigned based on each individual’s experience, skill sets, background, interest and the specific needs of the prototype. The Team structure document contains the roles, responsibilites, corresponding Agile Labor categories, and the total number of hours utilized to build the prototype. *[[Team Structure]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Team%20Structure.pdf)*

Our executive team met and assigned Anand and gave him authority to lead the prototype development and to ensure that we deliver a quality product to MDHS. Anand has over 18 years of technology integration expereince and led multi-disciplinary teams related to enterprise transformation. He also has experience in creating the foster care prototype for CA Agile Development Pre-Qualified Challenge.

# Research and Discovery

We created a user experience that was intuitive to the needs of actual foster parents and case workers. We started with discovery that included interviews, research, and conducted usability testing continuously with each iteration. With this collective knowledge, we developed personas to further define and personalize the prototype's core characteristics. 

Our cross-functional team met face-to-face in conference rooms, interviewed system users, had break out meetings, and collaborated daily to develop a prototype that exemplifies not only our technical and agile skills but the human-centered design principles. *[[Human Centered Design]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Human%20Centered%20Design.pdf)* 

Cambria team spent multiple sessions with actual users of the current application. These users were involved with the system extensively and were also a case worker. These users were also foster parents and therefore provided feedback that was essential for the design of the prototype.  *[[User Meeting Minutes]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/tree/master/artifacts/User-Research/Semi-Formal-Interviews)*

Cambria used qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors. The goals, needs, and behaviors were later transformed to user personas. *[[Research Methods]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User-Research/User_Research_and_Findings.pdf)* *[[Other Qualitative Research Methods]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/tree/master/artifacts/User-Research)* 

The team reached out to all Cambrianites via an email and they responded. The team assembled represented diverse backgrounds. Based on the experience, skills, and interests, the team quickly organized itself. Individuals aligned themselves to relevant roles. Camrbia tested the prototype with users that currently do not have a direct relationship with. While the unit testing was coducted by the representative users, the prototype was reviewed by the actual users for feedback. We used crowdsouring to gather the team members. *[[Crowdsourcing]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Crowdsourcing.pdf)*

From our interviews, we were able to directly create four personas based on biographical information, motivations, goals, frustrations, and tools utilized. Using this information as well as user research and feedback from our California Agile Development Pre-Qualification Vendor Pool prototype, we were able to craft personas more in line with the average family member or a caseworker looking for childcare facilities. The personas contain the users goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences. *[[Personas]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts/User%20Personas.pdf)*

Through small group discussions and follow-up research, the team iteratively defined the users we were targeting by developing the personas and then drilling down on the user stories. From the personas we crafted, we distilled our user stories, brief narratives of how a typical user might interact with our prototype. These user stories were then prioritized and assigned to several sprints. *[[Initial User Stories]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts/User%20Stories%20(Spreadsheet).xlsx)* *[[User Stories]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User%20Stories.pdf)*

# Design

Cambria used a very simple and flexible design style guide for the development of the prototype. We developed our style guide keeping in mind its significant impact on the way users perceive and feel about their interactive experience and the brand itself. We prioritized the following objectives: the use of inspirational pictures, friendly and empathetic tone, persona-based branding, being intuitive and relevant, conversational nature, and presentation of the Cambria brand. *[[Style Guide]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Style%20Guide.pdf)* *[[Style Guide Process]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts/Style-Guide-Process/Style%20Guide%20Process.pdf)*

The quick start guide contains clear inforamtion about the different pages in the applciation. This document also contains a description of the functional components available on the web page. *[[Quick Start Guide]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Quick%20Start%20Guide.pdf)*

Our Usability testing focused on understanding the users, their needs, and what they value. Our representative users became our testers. Utilizing a variety of devices, they tested across all sprints. Based on their feedback, we noted enhancements as issues for every sprint, and used the information collected to evaluate the usability of the application, and recommended improvements with each successive sprint. We also conducted accessibility testing using WAVE open-source tool. This tool automatically checked for accessibility of the prototype. The results are embedded in the Usability Testing document. *[[Usability Testing]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Usability%20Testing.pdf)* 

# Prototype (Technical Test)

This prototype works on multiple devices including desktops, laptops, android and iOS phones and tablets. We conducted usability testing on various devices to ensure its ease of use and responsive design. Cambria team used ‘Google Translate’ to translate the application to multiple languages. The objective was to ensure we can showcase the capability of reusing existing translation mechanisms rather than building custom objects for different languages as part of the prototype. *[[Responsive-Design]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Responsive%20Design.pdf)* *[[Spanish and Vietnamese Translation Feedback]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Language%20Translation.pdf)*  *[[Wireframes]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/tree/master/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts/Wireframes)* 

We used exclusively open source technologies and the prototype itself is also openly licensed and free of charge. *[[Open Source Technologies]](/artifacts/Technology%20Stack.md)* *[[Prototype Open Source License]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/LICENSE)* *[[Frameworks and Libraries Used]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Technology%20Stack.md)*

We used Azure as our production PaaS provider.  Azure provides rapid standup and deployment of containerized apps on any platform.  Operations is built in with the ability to integrate continuous deployment, alerts and real time traffic and site monitoring. *[[Our PaaS Platform]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Paas%20Platform.pdf)*

We developed automated unit tests for the code with adequate test coverage. The test scripts for the coverage and the results for successful deployments are stated here. *[[Automated Test Results]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Automated%20Testing.pdf)*

We used Mocha and Chai for unit testing as it ensures logic is working as expected and regressions do not creep in. We chose Kudu for continuous integration, which enabled us to run tests in isolated deployment slots and deploy to Azure all with a single 'git push' command. *[[Continuous Integration]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Paas%20Platform.pdf)*

We also listed all the information necessary to install and run the prototype on another target, if needed. *[[Instructions to install the prototype on another machine]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/SETUP.md)*
__________________________




We started developing our first user story within a couple of days. We learned a lot in the first sprint and never stopped learning, iterating, and adapting. We tested each core feature and made adjustments based on raised issues and feedback from our regular sprint retrospectives. From fixing bugs and issues to tweaking wireframes and visual design to adjusting the software stack, every aspect of each lifecycle was open to adjustments to ensure the prototype functioned and responded the way our users needed it to.


In developing this prototype, we utilized several human-centered design techniques: (1) user stories, (2) personas, (3) user interviews, (4) rapid prototyping using wireframes, (5) screen design sketches, and (6) usability testing.

We determined that the best product could only be developed by knowing, empathizing with, and understanding the user. We had a discovery/user interaction meeting with four users. Two of our users are subject matter experts who also have personal experience with the tools that are currently available to find child care facilities. *[[Personas]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts/MS%20ADPQ%20Personas.pptx)* *[[Our User Stories]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User%20Stories.pdf)* *[[Research Methods and Findings]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User-Research/User_Research_and_Findings.pdf)* *[[Frameworks and Libraries Used]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Technology%20Stack.md)* *[[Usability Testing]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Usability%20Testing.pdf)* *[[User Feedback 1]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User-Research/User%20Feedback%20Session%20Anna%20L%2010062016.pdf)* *[[User Feedback 2]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/User-Research/User%20Feedback%20Session%20Hannah%20M%2010062016.pdf)*

We conducted six sprints, each sprint informing the subsequent. Each sprint cycle began with a sprint planning meeting and ended with a sprint review and sprint retrospective meetings. We ran two-day sprints and held daily scrums to review the last 24 hours, the next 24 hours, and any impediments that the team might have had. The team started slow but soon picked up velocity and finished most of the development early with the last couple of sprints planned for addressing prioritized enhancements and issues. *[[Our Agile Process]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Agile%20Process.pdf)* *[[Our Agile Techniques]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/MSRFP-3717/blob/master/artifacts/Agile%20Techniques.md)*
